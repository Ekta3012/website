## PHPReboot.com

This repository contains the code of phpreboot.com website.

PHP Reboot is:

- Local PHP developers group in Pune, India.

In future, we are planning to extend to:

- PHP magazine (Collection of good and informative blog posts and news)
- PHP conference in India.
- Support and initiate PHP user group culture in other Indian cities.

Right now, it is mostly static web-site but we need to add above features in the site. Site is developed in Laravel 5.1 (LTS) and using 'Admin LTE' template for frontend.
